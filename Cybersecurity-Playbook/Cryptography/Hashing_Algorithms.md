MD5, SHA, Bcrypt

MD5, SHA “Secure Hash Algorithm”, and BCRYPT are cryptographic hashing algorithms, but while MD5 and SHA are primarily used to generate unique identifiers for data like files, bcrypt is specifically built for securely storing passwords. Bcrypt offers much greater resistance to brute-force attacks due to its iterative process and the use of a salt. As a result, MD5 and SHA are considered obsolete for password security and should be replaced by bcrypt in modern applications.
