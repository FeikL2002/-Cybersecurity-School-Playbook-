In Linux, monitoring and managing system resources like CPU, memory, and disk I/O is essential for maintaining performance and stability. Tools such as top, htop, vmstat, iostat, and df offer real-time insights into resource usage, enabling users to detect bottlenecks and optimize system performance.
CPU Monitoring
top – Displays real-time information on running processes and their CPU usage.


htop – A more interactive and user-friendly alternative to top, offering additional features.


Memory Monitoring
vmstat – Provides real-time statistics on system memory, virtual memory, paging, and CPU activity.


free – Shows detailed memory usage, including free, used, and swap space.


Disk I/O Monitoring
iostat – Reports CPU utilization and disk I/O performance.


df – Displays disk space usage for file systems.


Other Useful System Commands
uname – Shows system information, including OS name, version, and hardware details.


lscpu – Displays CPU architecture and details.


lspci – Lists PCI-connected devices.


lsusb – Displays connected USB devices.


lsblk – Shows details about storage block devices.


Resource Management
cgroups – A Linux kernel feature that enables resource allocation (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) among groups of processes in a hierarchical structure.
