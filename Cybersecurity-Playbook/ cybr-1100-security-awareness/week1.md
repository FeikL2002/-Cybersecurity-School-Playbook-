# Week 1 â€“ Introduction to Security Awareness
 
**Description:**  
We covered this week Key terms in cybersecurity also types of attackers we could be facing in this industry. We went over what building a security stragity learning how to block attacks,update defenses, minimize loses within a company.

**Reflection:**  
A few things I learned this week and how it connecets to the workforce. The 3 types of hackers I learned is white hat, black hat, and gray hat hackers. White hat hackers, also known as ethical hackers, use their skills legally to identify and fix security vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them. Black hat hackers, on the other hand, have criminal intent and exploit weaknesses for personal gain, such as stealing data or spreading malware. Gray hat hackers fall somewhere in between they may not have malicious motives but often break rules by probing systems without permission, sometimes disclosing vulnerabilities to the public rather than the organization itself. Understanding these hacker types helps businesses recognize both the threats they face and the resources available for defense.
To counter these threats, organizations must develop an effective security strategy that includes strong access controls, regular software updates, employee training, network monitoring, and incident response planning. A well-structured strategy not only protects sensitive data from cyberattacks but also ensures compliance with legal and industry regulations. In everyday workplaces, this means employees can work more confidently without constant fear of breaches, downtime, or data loss. By fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness, companies reduce risks, maintain productivity, and build trust with customers and partners, ultimately turning security into a business strength rather than just a defensive measure.


 
**AI Use Note:**  
I have used Chatgpt And Enovate AI, I used Chatgpt to proof read my work to give it another set of eyes over it i choose to never let ai do my work for me. I used Enovate AI to create AI videos.
