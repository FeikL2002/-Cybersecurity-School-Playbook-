***WannaCry Ransomware Case Study***

*In May 2017, the WannaCry ransomware worm spread rapidly across the globe, infecting more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries (Raconteur). WannaCry was a form of crypto-ransomware: it encrypted files on victim machines and demanded payment in Bitcoin for their release (Kaspersky).*

*The infiltration method relied on exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft’s Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, known as **EternalBlue**. This exploit was originally developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and later leaked online by the hacker group Shadow Brokers. Once WannaCry gained access to a single computer, it propagated autonomously across networks, requiring no user interaction such as opening an email or clicking a malicious link (WIRED).*

*The timeline of the outbreak is instructive. On **March 14, 2017**, Microsoft released patch MS17-010 to address the SMB flaw, but many organizations failed to apply it. On **April 14, 2017**, the Shadow Brokers leaked EternalBlue. Less than a month later, on **May 12, 2017**, WannaCry struck worldwide, crippling healthcare systems, businesses, and government agencies. By **May 13–14, 2017**, a British security researcher discovered and registered a hard-coded “kill switch” domain that slowed the malware’s spread (Wikipedia). In the following weeks, organizations scrambled to patch systems and recover, while some variants appeared but never reached the original attack’s scale (TechSpective).*

*The damage was severe. The UK’s **National Health Service (NHS)** was one of the hardest hit, with over 19,000 appointments canceled, medical equipment disabled, and ambulances diverted. The Department of Health and Social Care later estimated the cost at £92 million, with £20 million in lost output and £72 million in IT recovery (National Health Executive). Globally, the attack caused an estimated **$4 billion in losses** due to downtime, lost productivity, and recovery efforts (Raconteur). Companies such as FedEx, Telefónica in Spain, Deutsche Bahn in Germany, and Renault in France also suffered operational shutdowns (Wikipedia).*

*Ultimately, the WannaCry attack highlighted the catastrophic potential of ransomware when combined with unpatched vulnerabilities. It underscored the importance of timely updates, enforced security practices, and global cooperation in cybersecurity.*
