A personal cyber risk I have encountered involved oversharing on social media. A few years ago, I frequently posted updates about my daily activities, locations, and even vacation plans. At the time, it seemed harmless—I wanted to keep friends and family updated and enjoyed sharing photos in real time. However, I didn’t realize how much personal information I was exposing to strangers. By posting that I was out of town, for example, I was unintentionally signaling that my home was empty. In addition, sharing birthdays, pet names, and other details could have given cybercriminals clues to guess security questions or passwords. This behavior was risky because it made me vulnerable to both cyber threats and physical security risks. Criminals could use the information I shared to launch targeted phishing attempts, impersonate me online, or even plan a burglary while I was away. At the time, I had my profiles set to “friends only,” but I had not carefully reviewed who all those “friends” actually were, which widened my exposure. After learning more about cybersecurity, I now handle social networking much more cautiously. I avoid posting real-time updates about my location and wait until after a trip to share vacation photos. I also limit the amount of personal information in my profiles, regularly review privacy settings, and remove people I do not actually know from my friends list. By being more selective and intentional about what I share, I can still enjoy the benefits of social networking without putting myself at unnecessary risk. This experience has taught me that small changes in online behavior can significantly reduce both digital and physical threats.
