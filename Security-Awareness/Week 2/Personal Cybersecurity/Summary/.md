Summary:
In the Week 2 module on Network Components, Types, and Connections, I learned how the structure of a network directly impacts both security and vulnerability. Understanding devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls gave me a clearer picture of how information travels and where risks can arise. For example, an unsecured Wi-Fi router or outdated switch can become an entry point for attackers to intercept or manipulate traffic. I also saw how different types of networks wired, wireless, LANs, and WANs present unique challenges. Wireless networks in particular pose risks, since attackers can attempt to eavesdrop on communications or exploit weak encryption protocols like WEP. This module connected back to personal cyber risks by showing me how easily an attacker can target individuals through their home or public networks. Using unsecured public Wi-Fi, for instance, exposes users to man-in-the-middle attacks where sensitive data such as login credentials can be stolen. It made me reflect on times I had connected to open networks without a second thought, not realizing the risks. On the defense side, I learned that protecting personal devices and connections starts with strong encryption, updated hardware/software, and layered defenses. Using WPA3 on home Wi-Fi, changing default router passwords, and enabling firewalls are all practical steps. A virtual private network (VPN) adds additional protection when using public Wi-Fi by encrypting data end-to-end. Overall, this module emphasized that cybersecurity is not just about securing accounts, but also about securing the networks and connections that carry our information
