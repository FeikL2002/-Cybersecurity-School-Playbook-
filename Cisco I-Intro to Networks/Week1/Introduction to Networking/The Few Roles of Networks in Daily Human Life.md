      The Few Roles of Networks in Daily Human Life.

Networks play a vital role in modern society because they connect people, devices, and systems, making communication, information sharing, and essential services possible. From personal interactions to global business operations, networks form the invisible backbone of everyday life. This paper explores the key ways in which networks shape and support daily activities.
      
      Communication
One of the most important functions of networks is enabling communication. Social media platforms, email, video calls, and instant messaging apps rely on networks to connect people instantly across the world. Without these connections, staying in touch with family, friends, and colleagues over long distances would be slow, inconvenient, and far less efficient.
     
      Banking and Shopping
Modern financial transactions also depend on networks. Online banking, digital wallets, and e-commerce platforms use secure networks to transfer money and complete purchases. This not only saves time but also makes banking and shopping more convenient and widely accessible.

  
     Transportation and Navigation
Networks also improve mobility. GPS technology, ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft, and traffic monitoring systems all rely on networks to connect devices to satellites and central servers. These systems provide real-time directions, reduce travel times, and make transportation more efficient.
     
      
      Healthcare
In healthcare, networks save lives by supporting telemedicine, electronic health records, and hospital information systems. Networks enable doctors and nurses to share patient data quickly and securely, which improves diagnosis, treatment, and overall healthcare services.
