Explaining Encryption Types
Encryption generally falls into two main types: symmetric encryption “also known as secret-key encryption”, where the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting data, and asymmetric encryption “or public-key encryption”, which employs a pair of keys one public for encryption and one private for decryption. This setup allows anyone to send encrypted messages, but only the intended recipient can decrypt them. The Advanced Encryption Standard “AES” is a widely used example of symmetric encryption.While RSA is a prominent algorithm for asymmetric encryption.
