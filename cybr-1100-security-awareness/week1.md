# Week 1 – Introduction to Security Awareness 
   This week we covered key terms in cybersecurity and explored the different types of attackers we may face in the industry. We also discussed how to build a security strategy, including ways to block attacks, update defenses, and minimize losses within a company. 
 
Case Project 1-1:  
     One type of cyberattack I have personally experienced is a phishing attack. This happened in June 2022, shortly after I graduated high school. The device that was targeted was my Xbox Series X gaming system. At first, I did not fully realize what had happened, but the attack caused serious damage to the system’s RAM. From my understanding, this may have been similar to a “rowhammer” attack, which manipulates computer memory. Unfortunately, there was nothing I could do on my own to fix the damage, because rebuilding or repairing the Xbox would have been extremely expensive.
Looking back, I know there are precautions I could have taken to reduce the risk. For example, I could have used a stronger firewall, installed reliable antivirus protection, or been more cautious about suspicious links and messages. Phishing attacks often work because they trick users into letting their guard down, and gaming consoles can be easy targets. People typically log in to play for fun, without thinking about the dangers of the online world.
The attack I experienced was not just personal, it was part of a larger scheme. The attacker was able to gain access to the information of millions of users, including saved passwords, emails, and even credit and debit card details. This shows how dangerous phishing can be, especially when targeted at popular platforms. While the attacker may have believed they outsmarted the system, crimes like this usually result in serious legal consequences. I believe the person responsible likely ended up facing prison time for their actions.
This experience was an eye opener for me. It taught me that cyberattacks can happen to anyone, even through something as simple as a gaming console. It also reminded me of the importance of cybersecurity, not just on computers but on all connected devices. Being cautious and taking preventive steps can make the difference between safe gaming and becoming a victim of cybercrime.

Reflection:
     This week introduced me to the course structure, learning platforms, and some of the foundational networking concepts that will be built upon in future modules. I learned how to set up my GitHub portfolio and Playbook, which will serve as a place to showcase my work, track progress, and organize key materials throughout the course. I also began using Sage as a weekly guidance tool, which helps me stay on track and ensures I do not miss important assignments or deadlines. These tools are important because they provide both structure and accountability, making it easier to manage coursework while also building a professional portfolio that I can share beyond the classroom.
Completing the first Packet Tracer lab gave me hands-on experience with networking basics. Instead of just reading about devices and connections, I was able to simulate how they work together in a virtual environment. This matters because networking is a practical skill, and being able to experiment with Packet Tracer helps me understand concepts more deeply and apply them to real-world scenarios. Overall, this week laid the foundation not only for my success in the course but also for developing technical skills and professional tools that will be valuable in my future career.
