# Week 2- Network Components, Types, and Connections


Summary:
       In the Week 2 module on Network Components, Types, and Connections, I learned how the structure of a network directly impacts both security and vulnerability. Understanding devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls gave me a clearer picture of how information travels and where risks can arise. For example, an unsecured Wi-Fi router or outdated switch can become an entry point for attackers to intercept or manipulate traffic. I also saw how different types of networks wired, wireless, LANs, and WANs present unique challenges. Wireless networks in particular pose risks, since attackers can attempt to eavesdrop on communications or exploit weak encryption protocols like WEP.
     This module connected back to personal cyber risks by showing me how easily an attacker can target individuals through their home or public networks. Using unsecured public Wi-Fi, for instance, exposes users to man-in-the-middle attacks where sensitive data such as login credentials can be stolen. It made me reflect on times I had connected to open networks without a second thought, not realizing the risks.
     On the defense side, I learned that protecting personal devices and connections starts with strong encryption, updated hardware/software, and layered defenses. Using WPA3 on home Wi-Fi, changing default router passwords, and enabling firewalls are all practical steps. A virtual private network (VPN) adds additional protection when using public Wi-Fi by encrypting data end-to-end.
      Overall, this module emphasized that cybersecurity is not just about securing accounts, but also about securing the networks and connections that carry our information

Case Project 2-3: Protecting Yourself from Identity Theft
        After asking users to rank each password requirement on a scale of 1–5 (with 5 being most likely to follow), the results showed that most users were highly willing to adopt passphrases with 14 characters (average score: 4.5), as they found them easier to remember than complex random strings. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) also scored well (4.2), with many users already accustomed to using it for personal accounts. However, avoiding common words and personal information received a moderate score (3.7), as some admitted they might still be tempted to use memorable but less secure elements. The account lockout policy was ranked fairly high (4.0), as users recognized its importance, though a few worried about being locked out accidentally. The lowest-ranked requirement was regular password changes (2.8), with many users expressing frustration at frequent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that users are more willing to adopt long, memorable passphrases and MFA, but less enthusiastic about frequent mandatory changes, indicating that strong yet practical policies are the most effective.

Reflection:
        A personal cyber risk I have encountered involved oversharing on social media. A few years ago, I frequently posted updates about my daily activities, locations, and even vacation plans. At the time, it seemed harmless—I wanted to keep friends and family updated and enjoyed sharing photos in real time. However, I didn’t realize how much personal information I was exposing to strangers. By posting that I was out of town, for example, I was unintentionally signaling that my home was empty. In addition, sharing birthdays, pet names, and other details could have given cybercriminals clues to guess security questions or passwords.
     This behavior was risky because it made me vulnerable to both cyber threats and physical security risks. Criminals could use the information I shared to launch targeted phishing attempts, impersonate me online, or even plan a burglary while I was away. At the time, I had my profiles set to “friends only,” but I had not carefully reviewed who all those “friends” actually were, which widened my exposure.
After learning more about cybersecurity, I now handle social networking much more cautiously. I avoid posting real-time updates about my location and wait until after a trip to share vacation photos. I also limit the amount of personal information in my profiles, regularly review privacy settings, and remove people I do not actually know from my friends list. By being more selective and intentional about what I share, I can still enjoy the benefits of social networking without putting myself at unnecessary risk. This experience has taught me that small changes in online behavior can significantly reduce both digital and physical threats.
