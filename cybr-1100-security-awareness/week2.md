  Case Project 2-3: Protecting Yourself from Identity Theft
  
  After asking users to rank each password requirement on a scale of 1â€“5 (with 5 being most likely to follow), the results showed that most users were highly willing to adopt passphrases with 14 characters (average score: 4.5), as they found them easier to remember than complex random strings. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) also scored well (4.2), with many users already accustomed to using it for personal accounts. However, avoiding common words and personal information received a moderate score (3.7), as some admitted they might still be tempted to use memorable but less secure elements. The account lockout policy was ranked fairly high (4.0), as users recognized its importance, though a few worried about being locked out accidentally. The lowest-ranked requirement was regular password changes (2.8), with many users expressing frustration at frequent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that users are more willing to adopt long, memorable passphrases and MFA, but less enthusiastic about frequent mandatory changes, indicating that strong yet practical policies are the most effective.
