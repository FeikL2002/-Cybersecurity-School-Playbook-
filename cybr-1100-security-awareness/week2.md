Case Project 2-2: Password Requirements

Introduction
  Passwords are the first line of defense against unauthorized access to information systems. Poor password practices expose organizations to security breaches, data theft, and compliance violations. This project outlines recommended password requirements that balance strong security with usability for end-users.

  Proposed Password Requirements
Minimum Length At least 12 characters.
Longer passwords significantly reduce the risk of brute-force attacks.

Must include at least three of the following categories:
Uppercase letters (A–Z)
Lowercase letters (a–z)
Numbers (0–9)
Special characters (!, @, #, $, %, etc.)
Prohibited Passwords
No reuse of the last five passwords.

 Passwords must not contain:
The user’s name, username, or company name.
Dictionary words or easily guessed sequences (e.g., “12345678” or “password”).

 Expiration and Rotation
Passwords must be changed every 180 days.
Exceptions: Service accounts with strong encryption and monitoring may use longer rotation periods.

 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Strong passwords should be supplemented with MFA whenever possible (e.g., SMS code, authenticator app, or hardware token).

  
  Lockout Policy
Account locked after five failed login attempts.
 
 Lockout duration: 
15 minutes or until reset by administrator.
