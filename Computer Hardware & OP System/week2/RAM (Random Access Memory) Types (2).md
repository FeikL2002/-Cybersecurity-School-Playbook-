# ***RAM Types, Storage Devices, and Motherboard Components***

### ***RAM (Random Access Memory) Types***
*Random Access Memory (RAM) is the computer’s temporary memory, used while the system is running. Unlike storage, data in RAM is erased when 
the computer is turned off.*
*The two primary forms of RAM are **Static RAM (SRAM)** and **Dynamic RAM (DRAM)**.*
* ***SRAM (Static RAM)** is faster and more expensive. It is commonly used in CPU caches because it stores data using flip-flops, which retain 
information as long as the system has power.*
* ***DRAM (Dynamic RAM)** is slower and less costly, making it the standard for main system memory. It stores information in capacitors that 
must be refreshed thousands of times per second.*
*Several variations exist under DRAM:*
* ***SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM)** synchronizes with the CPU clock, improving speed over standard DRAM.*
* ***DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM)** transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock cycle. Versions of DDR include 
DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5. Each generation offers higher speed and lower power consumption. DDR4 is widely used today, while DDR5 is 
increasingly common in newer systems.*

### ***Storage Devices – Differences***
*Unlike RAM, storage devices hold data permanently. The main types include:*
* ***HDD (Hard Disk Drive):** Uses spinning magnetic disks, offering large capacity (often 1TB or more) at a lower cost. However, HDDs are 
slower, with speeds typically around 100–200 MB/s.*
* ***SSD (Solid State Drive):** Uses flash memory with no moving parts, making it far faster (500 MB/s to several GB/s) and more reliable. The 
cost per gigabyte is higher than HDDs.*
* ***NVMe SSD:** Connected via PCIe rather than SATA, these drives provide extremely high speeds—up to 7000 MB/s—and are common in modern 
desktops and laptops.*
* ***Optical Discs (CD/DVD/Blu-ray):** Use lasers to read and write data. While once standard, these are now largely obsolete except in media 
archives.*
* ***Flash Drives and Memory Cards:** Portable and convenient, but with lower durability and smaller capacity compared to SSDs.*

### ***Motherboard Components***
*The motherboard acts as the central hub connecting all components of the computer. Its key parts include:*
* ***CPU Socket:** The slot where the processor is installed.*
* ***RAM Slots (DIMM slots):** Hold the system’s memory modules.*
* ***Chipset:** Manages communication between the CPU, RAM, and peripherals.*
* ***Power Connectors:** Provide power from the power supply unit, including the 24-pin ATX connector and the 4/8-pin CPU connector.*
* ***PCIe Slots:** Expansion slots for graphics cards, sound cards, and other devices.*
* ***Storage Connectors:** SATA ports for HDDs and SSDs, and M.2 slots for NVMe SSDs.*
* ***USB Headers:** Connect to USB ports on the computer case.*
* ***I/O Ports (back panel):** External connectors such as USB, HDMI, audio jacks, and Ethernet.*
* ***BIOS/UEFI Chip:** Stores firmware settings that allow the system to boot and configure hardware.*
