RAM (Random Access Memory) Types
RAM is the computer’s temporary memory, used while the system is running. Data in RAM is erased when the power is turned off.
Main Types:
 # SRAM (Static RAM)


Faster, more expensive.


Used in CPU caches.


Stores data using flip-flops (retains data as long as powered).


# DRAM (Dynamic RAM)


Slower, cheaper, used as main system memory.


Stores data using capacitors, needs refreshing thousands of times per second.


# Under DRAM, we have:


SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM) – Syncs with CPU clock, faster than plain DRAM.


DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM) – Transfers data on both rising & falling edges of clock. Generations include:


DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, DDR5 – Each newer version is faster and uses less power.


Example: DDR4 is common in most PCs today, DDR5 in newer systems.



Storage Devices – Differences
Storage is permanent memory, unlike RAM.

# Types:
HDD (Hard Disk Drive)


Mechanical spinning disks.


Large capacity (1TB+), cheaper.


Slower (100–200 MB/s typical).


SSD (Solid State Drive)


No moving parts; uses flash memory.


Much faster (500 MB/s to several GB/s).


More expensive per GB.


NVMe SSD (connected via PCIe instead of SATA)


Very high speeds (up to 7000 MB/s).


Common in modern laptops/desktops.


Optical Discs (CD/DVD/Blu-ray)


Use laser technology.


Mostly obsolete now except in archives/media.


Flash Drives & Memory Cards


Portable, smaller capacity.


Convenient but less durable than SSDs.
