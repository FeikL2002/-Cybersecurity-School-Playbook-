  Major Internal Components (Lab 1)
  
 A computer’s major internal parts include the motherboard, CPU, RAM, storage, PSU, and expansion cards.
Motherboard: Central printed circuit board (PCB) that links and allows communication between all hardware components.

CPU (Central Processing Unit)
A small square chip often called the “brain” of the computer. It executes instructions and performs the calculations necessary for running software.


RAM (Random Access Memory)
The system’s short-term memory where active data is stored for quick access by the processor.


Storage Devices
Includes solid-state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs). These provide long-term, non-volatile storage of programs and files.


Power Supply Unit (PSU)
Converts high-voltage AC from the wall into low-voltage DC needed by internal hardware.


Expansion Cards
Plug-in hardware that adds or enhances capabilities (e.g., graphics cards, sound cards, network adapters).


ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) Precautions
 To protect sensitive components, always ground yourself, work on an anti-static mat, store parts in anti-static bags, disconnect power before handling, and avoid static-prone environments.
