Tools and methods for detecting malware! 
Antivirus Software: Scans for known malware using signature-based detection and heuristic methods to identify suspicious behavior.

Sandboxing: Suspicious files are executed in an isolated environment to monitor their behavior without affecting the actual system.

Behavioral Analysis: Monitors system or file activity to detect malicious behaviors, such as unauthorized changes or abnormal network connections.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Monitors network or host activity for signs of unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.
File Integrity Checkers: Compares files against known safe versions to detect unauthorized modifications by malware.

Machine Learning & AI: Uses data analysis to identify patterns in system behavior and files, classifying them as benign or malicious.

Rootkit Detection Tools: Specialized tools that detect hidden malware or activities running at the system's core.

Heuristic Analysis: Identifies potential malware by analyzing suspicious behaviors or code patterns, even if the malware is not in a signature database.

Network Traffic Analysis: Monitors network activity to detect abnormal traffic, such as communication with malicious IP addresses or data exfiltration.

Threat Intelligence Feeds: Utilizes shared information on known threats (IOCs) to detect malware using up-to-date indicators.

Cloud-based Malware Detection: Leverages cloud environments for scalable analysis of suspicious files, using sandboxing and threat intelligence.
