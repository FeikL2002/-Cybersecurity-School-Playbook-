Viruses: Malicious programs that attach to legitimate files or software and spread when the infected program is executed. Viruses replicate themselves and can damage or corrupt files, slow down systems, or disrupt operations.

Worms: Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks without needing a host file. Worms don't require user intervention and can cause network congestion.
Trojans: Malware disguised as trustworthy software that tricks users into installing it. Once executed, Trojans can steal data or give attackers control of the infected system.

Ransomware: Malware that locks or encrypts files and demands payment to restore access. Its goal is to extort money from the victim.

Adware: Software that displays intrusive ads. While not always harmful, adware can still disrupt the user experience and gather personal information.

Spyware: Malware that secretly tracks user activities and collects sensitive information, such as passwords or browsing habits.

Rootkits: Malware designed to hide itself or other malicious software from detection, allowing attackers to maintain control over the infected system.

Botnets: Networks of compromised devices controlled by attackers, often used for launching DDoS attacks or sending spam.
