A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a cybersecurity tool that safeguards users by encrypting their data and masking their IP addresses, helping to protect against identity theft, data breaches, and other online threats.
How does a VPN work?
Establishes a secure connection between a user’s device and a VPN server.
Encrypts data to make it unreadable and difficult to intercept.
Hides the user’s IP address and location.
Prevents ISPs and other trackers from monitoring browsing activity.
When should I use a VPN?
When handling sensitive information.
To protect against hackers, data breaches, and leaks.
To prevent ISPs and advertisers from tracking your online activity.
VPN security considerations:
While VPNs are generally secure, they are not foolproof.
VPNs may have vulnerabilities and do not cover all security risks.
It's essential to choose a reliable VPN provider.
Malicious actors can exploit VPN connections to gain unauthorized access to networks.
