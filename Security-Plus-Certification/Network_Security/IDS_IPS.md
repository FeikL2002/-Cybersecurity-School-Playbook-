In cybersecurity, IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is a tool that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and notifies administrators about potential threats. On the other hand, IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) goes beyond detection by actively blocking or preventing malicious traffic from entering the network, offering a more proactive approach compared to IDS. Both are critical for ensuring network security.
Key differences between IDS and IPS:
Functionality: An IDS detects potential intrusions by analyzing network traffic and generating alerts, whereas an IPS not only detects but also prevents intrusions by actively blocking malicious traffic.


Response to threats: An IDS alerts administrators about suspicious activity, requiring manual intervention to resolve the issue, while an IPS automatically takes actions such as blocking traffic or isolating infected devices.


Network placement: An IDS is usually deployed in "passive" mode, monitoring traffic without interfering with data flow, while an IPS is often placed "inline," allowing it to directly intercept and block harmful traffic.
